# Node.js Intermittent Null Request Object Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Node.js HTTP server intermittently receives a null request object.  The cause of this issue is currently undetermined, but it appears to be related to high request load or specific client configurations.

## Problem Description

The server code attempts to handle incoming HTTP requests. However, under certain conditions, the `req` object in the request handler is unexpectedly null. This leads to unhandled errors and server instability.

## Bug Reproduction Steps

The exact conditions leading to the null request are not consistently reproducible. It may require high load testing or specific client configurations.

## Solution

A robust error handling mechanism is implemented to catch the null request condition gracefully. The server logs an error but avoids crashing. This ensures continuous service operation even when encountering unexpected null request objects.

## Additional Notes

This bug might be specific to a particular Node.js version, or possibly an issue related to the underlying operating system or network configuration.  Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause.
